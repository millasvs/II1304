/*Splay trees:

A splay tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree with the additional property that recently accessed elements are quick to access again.
The tree is reorganized after every lookup, as opposed to an ordinary BST, in order to keep the element accessed most often in the root. This means that elements that are often accessed
are found in the top of the tree.

splaying the tree for a certain element rearranges the tree so that the element is placed at the root of the tree
Frequently accessed elements are moved nearer the root where they can be accessed again more quickly
Splay trees do not need to store any bookkeeping data

Disadvantages:
the height can be linear, which happens for example after accessing all n elements in a non-decreasing order.

Operations:
when a node x is accessed, a splay operation is performed on x to move it to the root, by carrying out a sequence of splay steps, each of which moves x closer to the root.
Each step depends on three factors:
- whether x is the left or right child of its parent node, p
- whether p is the root or not, and of not
- whether p is the left or right child of its parent, g (the grandparent of x).

After any splay operations, the great-grandparent of x (gg) is set to point to x.
If gg is null, x is the root and must be updated as such.

zig step:
This step is performed when p is the root. This rotates x to the root, p to the right of x and the right child of x to the left child of p.
Condition: When the last accessed node (node x) is a child of the root
operation: single left or right rootation.

zig-zig step:
this step is done when p is not the root and x and p are either both right children or are both left childrenof the root. This places x in the root, p as right child of x and g as a right child of p,
as well as rootating the right child of x to the left child of p and the right child of p to the left side of g.
Condition: When X is the left child of the parent P and P is the left child of the grandparent or if they are both right parents
Operation:

zig-zag step:
This step is performed when p is not the root and x is a right child and p is a left child or vice versa. This Places x in the root, g as a right child to x and p as a left child to x.
The left child of x is rotated to the right child of p, and the right child of x is rotated to the left child of g.
Condition: When X is the left child of P and P is the right child of G or vice versa
Operation: Double rootation

Retrieval:
Find node X using BST methods, then splay X up tp the root

Insertion:
Insert node X using BST methods, then splay X up to the root
